# About CMSIS-DSP 
CMSIS-DSP library is the component that provides an extensive suite of functions ranging from basic math to advanced filtering, all of which take advantage of the Cortex-M4's extended instruction set.

CMSIS-DSP is widely used in the industry, and enables optimized C code generation from various third-party tools. Arm has recently added new functions to the CMSIS-DSP library for classical ML, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive gaussian Bayes classifier and distances for clustering.


Armâ€™s Cortex-M4 (which is utilized by the PSoC 6), Cortex-M7, Cortex-M33, and Cortex-M35P processors all include additional instructions not found on the Cortex-M0(+) or Cortex-M3. These are the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) and Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) instructions, which allow for the efficient execution of computationally intensive DSP functions and algorithms. To take full advantage of these instructions would require a great deal of DSP and embedded programming expertise were it not for the CMSIS-DSP library. The library's source code is written mostly in C (utilizing several idioms and intrinsics) and a bit of assembly language to fully optimize it for the higher-end cores. ***Note that the CMSIS-DSP library will function correctly on the lower-end Cortex-M0(+) and Cortex-M3 cores, but not nearly as efficiently***. The library contains over 60 functions that operate on several data types. The library is divided into a number of modules each covering a specific category:

The library has separate functions for operating on 8-bit integers, 16-bit integers, 32-bit integers, and 32-bit floating-point
values.

***The library functions are declared in the public file arm_math.h which is placed in the Include folder. Simply include this file and link the appropriate library in the application and begin calling the library functions.***
