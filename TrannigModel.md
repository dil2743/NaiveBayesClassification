*    matplotlib (in python)

## How to train the model

The file [BayesianClassiferTrain.py](/ModelTraining/BayesianModelTrainer.py) contains all the code.

The training of the Bayesian classifier is relying on the scikit-learn library. So, we must import GaussianNB from the sklearn.naive_bayes module.
Training requires some data. The random, numpy, and math Python modules are imported for the data generation part.

The following Python code loads the required modules:
```
           from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
           import random
           import numpy as np
           import math
```
The following code generates three clusters of points:

```
       #3 cluster of points are generated
       ballRadius = 1.0
       x1 = [1.5, 1] +  ballRadius * np.random.randn(NBVECS,VECDIM)
       x2 = [-1.5, 1] + ballRadius * np.random.randn(NBVECS,VECDIM)
       x3 = [0, -3] + ballRadius * np.random.randn(NBVECS,VECDIM)
```

All the points and their classes are concatenated for the training.

Cluster A is class 0, cluster B is class 1, and cluster C is class 2.

The following code creates the array of inputs by concatenating the three clusters. This code also creates the array of outputs by concatenating the class numbers:
```
       #All points are concatenated
       X_train=np.concatenate((x1,x2,x3))
       #The classes are 0,1 and 2.
       Y_train=np.concatenate((np.zeros(NBVECS),np.ones(NBVECS),2*np.ones(NBVECS)))
```
The following code trains the Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes classifier on the input arrays that were just created:
```
       gnb = GaussianNB()
       gnb.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```
We can check the result by classifying a point in each cluster.

The following code checks that a point in cluster A is recognized as being in cluster A. The class number of cluster A is 0. This means that y_pred should be 0 when this code is executed:
```
       y_pred = gnb.predict([[1.5,1.0]])
       print(y_pred)
```
Now, we want to use this **trained classifier with the CMSIS-DSP**. For this, the parameters of the classifier must be dumped.

The CMSIS-DSP Bayesian classifier uses the instance structure that is shown in the following code. The parameters of this structure are needed by CMSIS-DSP and must be dumped from the Python script:
```
       typedef struct
      {
         uint32_t vectorDimension;  /**< Dimension of vector space */
         uint32_t numberOfClasses;  /**< Number of different classes  */
         const float32_t *theta;          /**< Mean values for the Gaussians */
         const float32_t *sigma;          /**< Variances for the Gaussians */
         const float32_t *classPriors;    /**< Class prior probabilities */
         float32_t epsilon;         /**< Additive value to variances */
       } arm_gaussian_naive_bayes_instance_f32;
```
The parameters that are required can be dumped with following Python code:

```
        print("Parameters")
        # Gaussian averages
        print("Theta = ",list(np.reshape(gnb.theta_,np.size(gnb.theta_))))

        # Gaussian variances
        print("Sigma = ",list(np.reshape(gnb.sigma_,np.size(gnb.sigma_))))

        # Class priors
        print("Prior =",list(np.reshape(gnb.class_prior_,np.size(gnb.class_prior_))))
        print("Epsilon = ",gnb.epsilon_)
```
